<div  style= "font-size:30px;  text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Meaning Of Html or Hypertext Markup Language:-</div>
<div style="font-size: 20px;">HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.

    In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.

    In this article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how it does things on web pages, and we'll also touch on a really cool part of HTML – Semantic HTML.</div>
<br>
<div><div  style= "font-size:30px;  text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">Html Tags</div>
<div style="display: flex;"><div style="font-size: 20px; height:auto; width: 70%;">Since HTML defines the markup for a particular web page, you'll want the text, images, or other embeds to appear in certain ways.
    
    For example, you might want some text to be big, other text to be small, and some to be bold, italic, or in bullet point form.
    
    HTML has "tags" that let you get this done. So, there are tags to create headings, paragraphs, bolded words, italicized words, and more.
    
    The image below describes the anatomy of an HTML tag:</div>
    <div> <img  style=" height: 180px; width: auto;" src="img\anatomy-of-an-html-tag.png"></div>
    
    </div></div>
    <div><div  style= "font-size:30px;  text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">HTML Attributes
    </div>
<div style="display: flex;"><div style="font-size: 20px; height:auto; width: 70%;">HTML tags also take what are called attributes. These attributes are placed in the opening tag and range from style and ids to classes. They take values, which convey more information about the element and help you do things such as styling and manipulation with JavaScript.

    In the infographic below, the opening tag contains a class attribute with a value of “text”. This can be used to style the element or select it with JavaScript for interactivity.

    <div> <img  style=" height: 180px; width: auto;" src="img/attribute-1.png"></div>
    
    </div></div>
   <div style= "font-size:30px;  text-decoration: underline; color: blue;"> Conclusion</div>
   <div style="font-size: 20px;">I hope this article has helped you learn the basics of HTML and what it does. Now you can start to learn more advanced technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, and then start forming a solid career in web development.

Thanks a lot for reading and have a nice time.</div>
